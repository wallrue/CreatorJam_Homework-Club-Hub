# Indigenomics AI Graph Chat Witness Sidecar

## Invitation

Build a sidecar that connects graph nodes, chat answers, citations, claims, evidence, and witness records so users can see what an answer is grounded in.

## What Could Be Built

- A node sidecar that lists source documents, claims, evidence, and witness records.
- A chat citation panel that separates answer text from source status.
- A "needs review" state for unsupported or stale claims.
- A receipt for AI-assisted summaries.

## Inputs

- `node_id`
- `chat_turn_id`
- `answer_text`
- `source_documents`
- `citation_links`
- `claims`
- `evidence_pointers`
- `witness_records`
- `review_state`
- `ai_use_receipt`

## Outputs

- Graph/chat witness sidecar.
- Citation and evidence table.
- Claim review diagnostics.
- AI-assisted answer receipt.
- Follow-up repair tasks.

## Acceptance Criteria

- Users can inspect which sources support an answer.
- Claims are separate from citations and can have their own review status.
- Stale, missing, contested, or local-only sources are visible.
- AI-assisted answers include a receipt of source material and reviewer status.
- Protected source content does not leak through citations or summaries.

## Refusal Boundaries

- Do not present chat answers as authoritative because they have citations.
- Do not expose private source content in snippets.
- Do not auto-upgrade a citation into a verified claim.
- Do not hide contested or missing evidence.

## First Build Step

Create a static sidecar fixture for one graph node, one chat answer, three citations, two claims, and one reviewer diagnostic.

## Source Notes

Synthesized from IndigenomicsAI graph/chat app surfaces, claims evidence specs, and witness receipt patterns.
