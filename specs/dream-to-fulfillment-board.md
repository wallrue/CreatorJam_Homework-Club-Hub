# Dream To Fulfillment Board

## Invitation

Build a board that tracks the movement from dream to vision, care, offer, need, promise, witnessed commitment, fulfilled work, and receipt.

## What Could Be Built

- A kanban-style board for commitment speech acts.
- A record model for dreams, offers, needs, promises, refusals, commitments, and fulfillment.
- A transition validator.
- A witness receipt rollup for completed work.

## Inputs

- `item_id`
- `speech_act`: dream, vision, care, offer, need, promise, refusal, witnessed_commitment, fulfilled, receipt
- `summary`
- `issuer`
- `beneficiary`
- `timeframe`
- `dependencies`
- `witness_records`
- `evidence_pointers`
- `visibility_tier`
- `review_state`

## Outputs

- Dream to Fulfillment Board.
- Transition diagnostics.
- Commitment bundle candidates.
- Fulfillment receipt rollup.

## Acceptance Criteria

- A dream can remain a dream without being forced into delivery logic.
- Refusals and constraints are visible and respected.
- A promise cannot become a witnessed commitment without witness context.
- Fulfillment requires review or evidence appropriate to the intended use.
- Public board exports use sample-safe summaries.

## Refusal Boundaries

- Do not pressure participants to turn care, story, or dreams into commitments.
- Do not treat a promise as fulfilled because it moved columns.
- Do not publish private relational commitments.
- Do not convert refusals into backlog items.

## First Build Step

Create a board fixture with eight items and two transition diagnostics, then render it as markdown or a small web view.

## Source Notes

Synthesized from stewardship-of-commitments essays, commitment pool notes, and Creator Jam bundle workflows.
